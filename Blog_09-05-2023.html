    <h1>Concord Man Searched Relentlessly During 12-Year Layover</h1>
    <p>A 44 year old Concord man returned home after a grounded flight turned into a 12 year layover in Ho-waii.</p>
    <p>According to sources involved in the situation, the plane had problems during takeoff which were left unresolved and ended up being the catalyst for the snowball of events that subsequently brought the plane down midflight.</p>
    <p>Luckily, no passengers were hurt; most were put on another flight to continue to their destination.</p> 
    <p> One passenger from Concord (44), who chooses to remain anonymous, did not, however, give up on the malfunctioning aircraft. In an exclusive interview, he explains the situation in more detail:</p>
    <p>"When I asked the what was wrong with the plane, the solution seemed simple enough. It was one single part.  No big deal."</p>
    <p>The part the man was referring to, a HxH hose adapter, had not actually ever been installed on the plane to begin with.  In fact, the part seems to not exist at all. </p>
    <p>"There are a ton of hose adapters out there: hose to sink, hose to appliance, etc.," the man explained, still visibly distraught over the exhausting episode.  "I'm finally convinced there is one they dont make:  The hose to housewives."</p>
    <p>The Concord man is currently recovering from his 12-year lapse of common sense in the quiet San Francisco neighborhood of Glen Park. </p>
    <p>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story.</p>
